  abstract = {Travel mode choice plays a significant role in addressing urban challenges such as congestion, pollution, and accessibility. Accurate forecasting of travel behavior, especially understanding how individuals commute for various activities, is crucial for achieving sustainability goals. People have various transportation options for their daily trips, and understanding these preferences is essential for effective urban planning. This paper explores the prediction of trip mode choice, focusing on whether individuals prefer public or private transportation. We develop and evaluate prediction models using three machine learning algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest. These models were trained using datasets from the 2022 National Household Travel Survey. The performance of the models is assessed using several metrics, including average accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, and a simple ranking system. Additionally, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) is used to interpret the models and identify the most influential variables in predicting the choice between public and private transportation. This research underscores the potential of machine learning methods in understanding and predicting travel mode choices, offering valuable insights for urban planners aiming to reduce congestion and promote sustainable transportation options.},

  abstract={An efficient and effective system for classifying and detecting concrete surface deterioration is essential for timely repair and extending the lifespan of concrete structures. The existing manual inspection methods are labor-intensive and susceptible to human mistakes, potentially resulting in delays in remediation and increased repair expenses. This paper introduces an artificial intelligence solution that uses the YOLOv11 model to automatically detect and classify six common types of concrete surface degradation: exposed reinforcement, rust stain, scaling, spalling, cracks, and efflorescence. A dataset including 6,806 photos, collected and annotated from publicly accessible sources, was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets and augmented by various methods, including rotation, scaling, translation, and color jittering, to improve the robustness of the proposed model. The model was trained and tested using the Ultralytics YOLO framework, and performance was assessed through precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP). According to the results of this study, the YOLOv11-based method is more accurate and useful for identifying surface degradation in concrete than traditional human inspection methods. This automated method can significantly decrease inspection duration, enhance reliability, and facilitate efficient infrastructure maintenance.},
