  abstract = {Travel mode choice plays a significant role in addressing urban challenges such as congestion, pollution, and accessibility. Accurate forecasting of travel behavior, especially understanding how individuals commute for various activities, is crucial for achieving sustainability goals. People have various transportation options for their daily trips, and understanding these preferences is essential for effective urban planning. This paper explores the prediction of trip mode choice, focusing on whether individuals prefer public or private transportation. We develop and evaluate prediction models using three machine learning algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest. These models were trained using datasets from the 2022 National Household Travel Survey. The performance of the models is assessed using several metrics, including average accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, and a simple ranking system. Additionally, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) is used to interpret the models and identify the most influential variables in predicting the choice between public and private transportation. This research underscores the potential of machine learning methods in understanding and predicting travel mode choices, offering valuable insights for urban planners aiming to reduce congestion and promote sustainable transportation options.},
