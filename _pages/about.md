<hr>
I am an undergraduate student in the <a href="https://cuet.ac.bd/department/CE">Department of Civil Engineering</a> at <a href="https://cuet.ac.bd/">Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET).

<!-- In Winter of 2020, I worked as an intern researcher at the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/">Technische Universität Berlin</a>, under supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/vsp/ueber-uns/fachgebietsleitung">Kai Nagel</a>. -->

<i>
My main research interests are in reinforcement learning (RL) and its use to empower artificial intelligence (AI) agents to solve real-world problems.
